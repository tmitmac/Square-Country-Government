    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Innovation Party Says It Will Not Work With Liberty</h1>
    <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm mb-6">January 25, 2026</p>
    
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Following the <strong>Innovation Party’s historic result</strong> in the latest political poll, the party today formally announced that it will <strong>not enter into any working arrangement</strong> with the <strong>Liberty Party</strong> ahead of the general election later this year. The decision adds complexity to an already fragmented political landscape, where minor parties are poised to play a decisive role in forming the next government.</p>
    
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Currently, Liberty holds a majority in the legislature, but analysts say it is likely that the next government will be a coalition reliant on smaller parties. Innovation Party leader <strong>Sarah Voss</strong> said that while her party welcomes the historic support reflected in recent polls, it had drawn a firm line on working with Liberty. According to Voss, Liberty’s policy platform — particularly its stance on deregulation, rollback of social protections, and immigration — <strong>fundamentally contradicts Innovation’s core priorities on sustainable technology investment, climate policy, and digital governance reform</strong>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4"><em>“We will cooperate with parties that share our vision for a forward‑looking and equitable Square Country. Unfortunately, our internal review and discussions across our caucus have made it clear we cannot, in good conscience, work with Liberty — not at the cabinet level, not informally,”</em> Voss said, emphasising that the decision was unanimous among Innovation’s parliamentary representatives.</p>


    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-2">Liberty Party Responds</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Liberty Party officials reacted sharply to Innovation’s announcement. Prime Minister <strong>Ryan Parker</strong> accused Innovation of “political posturing” and argued that the refusal to even negotiate undermined efforts to unify the centre and centre‑right blocs ahead of the election.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4"><em>“Innovation’s refusal to engage with Liberty is disappointing and short‑sighted. We have common ground on economic growth, regulatory reform, and individual freedoms. Failing to talk to us serves no one but the radical, racist, extremists in the Freedoms Party, and their close friends in the Greens,”</em> Parker said.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-2">Political Impasse Deepens</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Analysts say Innovation’s refusal to work with Liberty narrows the field of workable coalitions. With neither major bloc expected to hold a clear majority after the upcoming election, smaller parties such as the <strong>Square Country Greens</strong> and <strong>Square Country First</strong> may play a decisive role in determining the next government.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4"><em>“It’s shaping up to be a classic hung parliament scenario. Innovation’s move might be principled, but it also hands greater leverage to parties whose platforms differ sharply on fiscal and social policy. Square Country’s next steps after the election are now uncertain,”</em> said political commentator <strong>Ravi Trask</strong>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Negotiations and pre-election discussions are expected to continue over the coming months, as all parties seek to secure alliances and influence in the likely coalition government.</p>
