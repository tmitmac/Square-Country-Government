                Prime Minister Ryan Parker Sets Election Date, Unveils Northern Prosperity Plan
            </h1>
            <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm mb-6">February 3, 2026</p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Prime Minister <strong>Ryan Parker</strong> has confirmed that Square Country will head to the polls on
                <strong>17 October</strong>, formally launching the election year with the release of the government’s
                first major policy: the <strong>Northern Prosperity Plan</strong>.
            </p>


            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                The plan is aimed squarely at the <strong>Northern Territories</strong>, with the government promising
                to supercharge economic growth, attract private investment, and create tens of thousands of
                well-paying jobs — without relying on what Parker described as “blank-cheque handouts.”

                Making the North a Magnet for Investment
            </h2>

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                A central feature of the policy is the creation of <strong>Northern Investment Zones (NIZs)</strong>,
                which will designate key urban centres, industrial hubs, and emerging tech clusters as priority
                development areas. Businesses operating in these zones will receive a
                <strong>50% reduction in corporate tax for their first five years</strong>, along with additional
                deductions for hiring local workers.
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Planning approvals for manufacturing, technology, and clean-energy projects will also be fast-tracked,
                with the government aiming to cut red tape and reduce approval times by up to 40 percent.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-2">
                Infrastructure and Skills at the Core
            </h2>

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                The Northern Prosperity Plan commits to a major infrastructure push, including upgrades to regional
                roads and highways, modernisation of ports to support exports, and expanded high-speed broadband
                across northern towns and cities. Many projects will be delivered through
                <strong>public-private partnerships</strong>, combining private capital with government oversight.
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Alongside infrastructure, the government will roll out a
                <strong>Northern Skills & Jobs Program</strong>, funding apprenticeships, technical training, and
                upskilling in high-demand sectors such as manufacturing, clean energy, IT, and logistics.
                Northern Skills Hubs will be established to connect training directly with local job placements.
            </p>

                Support for Local Industry and Agriculture
            </h2>

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Local industries — including <strong>agriculture, forestry, tourism, and technology startups</strong> —
                will receive targeted support through grants, low-interest loans, and export assistance. A new
                Northern Export Accelerator Program will help northern businesses expand into international markets,
                while innovation hubs will encourage collaboration between universities and industry.
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                The government estimates the plan will cost between <strong>$1.8 and $2.5 billion over five years</strong>,
                funded through reallocated spending, infrastructure bonds, and private-sector partnerships.
            </p>

                Greens Push Back
            </h2>

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Green Party leader <strong>Erin Starling</strong> criticised the announcement, warning that the plan risks
                prioritising growth over environmental protection in the Northern Territories.
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                <em>“This plan puts tax breaks and fast-tracked approvals ahead of environmental safeguards,”</em>
                Starling said. <em>“Without stronger protections, large-scale development could damage fragile northern
                ecosystems and undermine long-term sustainability.”</em>
            </p>

                Election Battle Lines Drawn
            </h2>

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                With the election date now locked in, analysts say the Northern Prosperity Plan will form a central
                plank of Liberty’s campaign. While the party currently governs with a majority, recent polling suggests
                October’s vote could result in a more fragmented parliament — making regional development policies a
                key battleground for undecided voters.
