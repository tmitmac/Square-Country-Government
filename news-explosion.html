            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Late yesterday afternoon, an explosion at the base of the Freedoms Party Headquarters shocked the nation, as political violence becomes more extreme.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">The explosion was heard and felt throughout the city as a remote-detonated bomb was used on the south side of the building, tearing up grass, pathways, and creating fears about the structural integrity of the building.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Police Commissioner, Eden Glencross, announced a national investigation was underway at a press conference this morning. "We are and will always be searching for and destroying heinous political violence that has no place in Square Country."</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">It is currently believed that the attack was carried out by a 'Free Rivoria' protester, thanks to CCTV surveillance in the area. Although, these claims remain unconfirmed by the Commissioner.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Needless to say, this attack has crippled the already flailing Freedoms Party, who are still undergoing a leadership change, with no replacement for Hayden Pullar confirmed. No one from within the party has commented on yesterday's attack.</p>             
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Unexpectedly, however, a large basement beneath the Freedoms HQ was discovered, as a hole created by the explosion literally shed light into what appears to be undocumented and shady business dealings.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">The Ministry of Labour & Employment today confirmed that no formal business application had been lodged, and any businesses operating in that space would be illegal.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Prime Minister Ryan Parker offered a brief statement in regards to the attack. "I offer my sympathies to those who have been affected by this terrible act of political violence. Freedoms are already going through a troubling time, and this is yet another blow for a divided and fragmented party." 
                                          Parker also voiced concern about the uncovered basement beneath the building. "What are they doing down there? It seems shady to say the least." When asked by the National News Studio why this attack happened, Parker admitted that "the ongoing war efforts in Rivoria are dividing the country, but we must defeat terror and lawlessness, whatever the cost."</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Voices from across Parliament have shared their concern about the "tone-deaf speech" from the Prime Minister, with Erin Starling accusing the Prime Minister of having "something to do with it."</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Whilst investigations into the nature of the explosion at Freedoms HQ are underway, it is unclear whether any criminal investigation is underway for the basement beneath the building.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">The Masterton City Council has assured locals and visitors alike that there is no ongoing threat to public safety, and this is an isolated incident.</p>
