            <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">The End of Two-Party Politics?</h1>
            <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm mb-6">December 31, 2025</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Alas, we have reached the end of another politically tumultuous year. Scandals, resignations, court trials, an entire war, and political policy–some successful, and others not quite.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">As we enter an election year, Square Country News has conducted its final political poll for 2025. This was in correspondence with Square Country Herald and the National News Studio. Its findings help experts and voters grasp an idea of the political climate moving into 2026. For the first time in more than a decade, we could be in for a major shake-up to the make-up of Square Country’s Parliament. </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4"><strong>Party Vote</strong></p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">First up, the Liberty Party has taken a massive hit in the SCN political poll, dropping 12 points to 29%. Likely as a result of the ongoing Rivorian War, and lagging reconstruction of the Square City CBD. This is despite major transport infrastructure efforts by Minister Campbell Craw, with the Prunty Ranges Bypass and new Square City Harbour Bridge, with his work securing him a new spot in the Preferred Prime Minister poll. Red Tape cutting and economic reform simply aren't on the minds of voters, and their polling shows just that. Freedoms wasn’t too lucky either, dropping 7 points to 24%. UNDETERMINED’s lackluster campaign policies over the last few months has proven a poor strategy for the Prime Minister hopeful. Despite stepping deep into the rural communities of the North, East, and South, Freedoms’ message of “Stronger futures, together,” hasn’t resonated with voters, leaving many dissociated and confused with contrasting ideas from UNDETERMINED now, compared to last election. </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">However, where votes are lost, votes are gained. The several minor parties that make up Square Country’s Parliament have seen a surge in popularity, all seemingly at once. The SC Green Party: up 14 points to 23%, just 1 point shy of Freedoms. Innovation Party: up 6 points to 14%. SC First: up 3 points to 6%, an historic result for the party. And of course, the controversial Anti-Immigration Party, securing themselves a result of 4%, almost enough for just one seat in Parliament, but an incredible amount of influence. But, what does this show? The big players are falling out of touch and out of favour with voters, who are instead opting for a fresh touch in the form of several minor parties. Together, their influence will be more than double that of Liberty and Freedoms together.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4"><strong>Results:</strong></p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">LIB - 29%</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">FRE - 24%</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">GRE - 23%</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">INN - 14%</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">SCF - 6%</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">AIP - 4%</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4"><strong>Preferred Prime Minister</strong></p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Needless to say, Prime Minister Parker has remained steady with his traditional support. Despite several shortcomings, his key moments from this year have shown solidarity and unity, both within his party and across the country. Parker remains at 38%, a solid result giving him a solid lead above his counterpart UNDETERMINED. Speaking of which, following not too close behind Leader of the Opposition, UNDETERMINED, rises to just over 31% from his lowest ever result of 22% three months ago. Although his policies and early campaigning have proven unbeneficial, his likeability is at an all time high. This is, in part, thanks to his community outreach, particularly, in smaller communities across the country. SC Greens’ Erin Starling has risen to 17%, her highest result as well. Her speeches and campaigning on a fairer tax system and wealthy “paying their share” has garnered her and her party more support than they’ve ever seen. Former Prime Minister and current Minister of Finance, Education, and Justice, Trent McKenzie has dropped to 2%, whilst a new face has appeared. Campbell Craw, Minister of Transport & Infrastructure, has shown his face as a Preferred Prime Minister for the first time. At 11% Craw is slowly securing the support of the country and undoubtedly, his own party. Could there be a potential coup against Prime Minister Parker? Craw has refused to comment on the poll, highlighting a sense of stealth in his political movements. Ryan Parker will likely lead the country into the 2026 General Election, but rumours are circulating through Masterton, and they may culminate in a fiery challenge next year.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4"><strong>Results:</strong></p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Ryan Parker - 38%</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">UNDETERMINED - 31%</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Erin Starling - 17%</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Campbell Craw - 11%</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Trent McKenzie - 2%</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Other - 1%</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4"><strong>Seats in the House</strong></p>        
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Finally, how does this stack up as seats in the House of Representatives, and what might the next government look like? Undoubtedly, Liberty would lose their absolute majority, down to 8 seats, just over half of their current standings. At this point, a coalition is inevitable. Freedoms remains at 6 seats, nowhere near forming a government by themselves. For the first time, however, SC Greens break their 3 seat record, doubling it to equalise with Freedoms at 6 seats. Innovation, led by Sarah Voss, would have 4 seats, quadrupling their current numbers. And finally, Square Country First doubles their seats to reach 2. These results show a divided parliament, unsure of the future of a Liberty-Freedoms dominated landscape, and unaware of the true future of our politics. </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4"><strong>Results:</strong></p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">LIB - 8 Seats</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">FRE - 6 Seats</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">GRE - 6 Seats</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">INN - 4 Seats</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">SCF - 2 Seats</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Whatever the result is next year, it is always important to make your voice heard. Vote. Vote for your future. Vote for your families. Vote for your livelihoods. And vote for what matters. </p>
