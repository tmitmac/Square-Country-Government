        <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Trent M. McKenzie. His Tenure in Review.</h1>
        <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm mb-6">December 4, 2025</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Trent M. McKenzie became the 30th Prime Minister of Square Country following the turmoil and resignation of his predecessor Ian Feld, which saw trust in the national government plummet almost overnight.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Just days after he ascended to the premiership, McKenzie called an immediate snap election, the first in more than four decades. McKenzie saw it as an opportunity for the constituents of Square Country to have their say on the government. Especially, given their lack-of-trust at the time.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Against all odds, and polls, McKenzie secured a third term for the incumbent Liberty Party, pledging to secure the future of all citizens and foster stronger connections both domestically and internationally.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">His first challenge, however, arrived in 2020, with the global COVID-19 pandemic stalling economic growth, and straining the already flailing healthcare system. Acting quickly, McKenzie put Square Country in lockdown, in an act that hadn't been seen since Yealands' wartime leadership. This stopped the transimission of the virus and shunted the economy into a period of growth. This in stark contrast to almost every other nation in the world. COVID-related spending was among the lowest in the OECD, yet the country was much the better for it. Overseas, he was praised for his quick action, saving Square Country from years of future economic despair</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">In mid-2021, the July 11 bombing of the Thompson Tower, which saw 47 people die, was the worst act of terrorism in the country's history. McKenzie's leadership showed solidarity throughout Square Country, and created a sense of belonging for those international families impacted by the hotel's bombing.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">2022 was supposed to be the year of "smooth-sailing," as McKenzie put it. But, the Rivorian attack on the United Mexican States sent the Square Country Armed Forces into their biggest international conflict since the second world war. Despite strong domestic oppostion, "Operation Liberty" began. The Rivorian War has continued to this day, and unfortunately, shows little sign of slowing.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Throughout 2023, McKenzie oversaw the war efforts in Rivoria, desperate to win, but reluctant to carry on. Through the advice of his Minster of Defence, Ryan Parker, he pushed foward with the conflict. His second election as Prime Minister came in November, and to the surprise of few, he waltzed into the premiership for a second time, extending his majority from 48.7% to 52.1%. The resignation of his deputy Prime Minister, Norman Chylinksi, saw the--almost--rise to power of Ryan D. Parker, just one short step away from the top-job.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">The following year was "calm," using his own words. The war effort in Rivoria was tipping slightly in favour of the Squares, and the economic-boom was finally hitting the country. Desmond R. Cullen, an idol of McKenzie, died, leaving a deep hole and a change in McKenzie's leadership And, finally, the parliamentary cricket team accepted the Prime Minister onto the field, something he had been desperate to acheive for years.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Then, the tumultuous 2025. What began as well, some might even describe as swimmingly, ended in disaster for the Prime Minister. The unravelling of the Premier began on a September night at the White House. A dinner invitation to the Leader of the Opposition ended in accusations of "kiddy-fiddling," culminating in the dismissal of the 30th Prime Minister.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">The top-job? Now held by Ryan D. Parker. The man who stood beside McKenzie for years, was the one campaigning for his dissmissal. What began in troubling times for the Liberty Party ended again in further troubling time for that very same party. What comes next for the current Prime Minister? Will the Liberty Party clinch a fifth term in power?</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Well, it's hard to say. But, Trent M. McKenzie will certainly be a long way from the premiership just as he had started.</p>
